      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Green bean recipes make the greatest side dishes. They take very little
        time to cook and, depending on the method, even less time to prep. This
        easy green bean recipe preps in just 5 minutes, cooks in about 10
        (depending on how crunchy you like your green beans), and is ready in 15
        minutes.

      <h2>Steps and Instructions</h2>

        <li>
          <strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring the green beans to a boil, then reduce
          to a simmer until they're just tender. For this green bean recipe,
          it's better to undercook slightly than overcook. Drain the green beans
          and return them to the skillet. The residual heat will continue to
          cook the green beans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Saut√©:</strong> Add butter to the hot skillet. Add minced
          garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure the green beans are
          coated with the garlicy butter. Season and serve.
