        dinner. Convenient pre-cut broccoli florets save time, and ground beef
        takes the place of sliced beef for ease. The simple stir-fry sauce

      <h2>Steps and Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Whisk together beef broth, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, ginger,
          garlic, and rice vinegar in a bowl until combined and sugar and
          cornstarch are dissolved; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
          until shimmering. Add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
          softened, about 2 minutes. Add broccoli, and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until bright green, tender-crisp, and onion is browned,
          6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the heat to medium, and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to
          skillet. Add ground beef and salt, and cook, stirring often to break
          meat into even crumbles, until browned and cooked through, about 5
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk broth mixture again, and pour into skillet. Cook over medium
          heat, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens slightly, 3 to 5
          minutes. Return broccoli mixture to skillet, and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until sauce evenly coats meat and vegetables, 3 to 4
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve over rice, and garnish with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
        </li>
      </ol>
